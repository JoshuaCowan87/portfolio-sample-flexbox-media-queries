              <p>Hello there! Thanks for checking our this site. This is a great opportunity to learn a little about me, the work I do and what I can bring to a team!
                After a 12 year career in foodservice, during which I started and ran a successful food truck and catering business for six years, I made a career change into software engineering. I saw a big need within the foodservice industry to expand and grow their business using the new technology and programs. So I wanted to combine my interest in programming with my experience in foodservice and bring a unique set of skills to the market.</p>

              <p>In taking Thinkful's software engineering program and a lot of self-teaching, I learned the skills and gained the experience to be a qualified programmer. I focus on javascript, HTML, and CSS. By running my own business I showed that I am a strong team leader, capable of taking initiative with projects, training and managing teams, creating and sticking to timelines, and able to adapt to new situations. Any entrepreneur will agree you have to constantly adapt to new situations, such as adapting a food service business to grow and thrive during a global pandemic! </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-me">
          <p> Being in this field is very exciting and enticing. There are countless ways programming can be helpful to us in our everyday lives and business. New technology and advances are occurring every day, making each year to be substantial progress. Although these are common household names now, when they first arrived on the market they were game-changers for all businesses, especially small businesses. Things such as Square register, Squarespace, PayPal, LinkedIn, Slack, Quickbooks, Hipchat, Wave, and iTranslate, just to name a few. These simple programs took complex coding and made it accessible to novices and small business owners.</p>
          <p>Necessity is the mother of innovation. These programs were created by teams that saw a need and responded. As the world grows more and more complex, similar programs offer the ability to make it all more approachable. But it also takes collaboration. It takes people with a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets to create something amazing. I hope to be on a team that can join forces and create something amazing.</p>
          
            Soon I hope to be able to offer my services to a collaborative team or directly to clients. Such as 
                    <ul>
                            <li>Front End Web Development</li>
                            <li>Back End Web Development</li>
                            <li>Creating programs to help direct needs of small business owners</li> 
                            <li>Provide insight and training of existing programs for customers</li>
                    </ul>
          
            <p class="no-margin">I know what you are thinking... "Now that all sounds like a lot of work (albeit fun work), but what do you do outside of work?" When I am not brainstorming my next project, I like to spend time with my family (wife, 2.5-year-old and newborn). We enjoy working on our garden, our lounging with our animals. Or adventuring in the outdoors such as rock climbing, mountain biking, and surfing. But to top off the perfect day, I would need to cook a pizza in our wood-fired oven.</p>
